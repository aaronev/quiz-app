//create quiz app using object constructor notation and prototype methods
//constructor will take an object  with question answer as key value pair
//key would be the question
//value would be the answer
//first create constructor and prototype
//then add methods to render the q's
//if user input answers match the key's value then turn to green
//this will be the plan for now just to keep quiz app simpe
